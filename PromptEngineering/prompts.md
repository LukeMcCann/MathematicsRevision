# Prompt Engineering

## Introduction

Prompt Engineering is a relatively new concept but one which
is growing fast as AI is set to become the dominant force in
the technology industry. Just like anything, AI understands
some prompt better than others, and how well you define the
parameters of your prompts will depend on the effectiveness
of the results you receive.

As a Software Engineer I always had a great interest in AI
and Machine Learning, spending at least 2 of my 5 year masters
studying and playing with AI and Machine Learning techniques.
Even so, I could never have imagined how suddenly and quickly
AI would begin to take off, since ChatGPT the industry has seen
a Boom in AI use in both professional and personal settings.
Whilst I think it important to have a respectful amount of
concern with the implications of this I also have a love for
how it can be used to enhance our own learning.

In recent months I have played around a lot with ChatGPT
for my own gain. I have tried many different prompting
techniques, some which worked, some which didn't, all
with the goal of enhancing my own knowledge. Rather than
having AI do the work for us, I think a far better use
is to use it to enhance our own learning and development.
As such, I have registered some of the more successful
prompts here, with some explanation, as to how to more
effectively use AI like ChatGPT to enhance your own
skill-set, whether you want to be a better developer,
have a better fitness and diet regime, or receive
feedback on your own thoughts, AI can be a useful
non-judgemental third party which you can access
at all hours. No need to feel bad for waking your
professor if your professor never sleeps!

## How does Prompt Engineering Work

So, if you are reading this it is likely you have
played with AI somewhat. Some of you may have put
in a few questions and found underwhelming responses
and thought "what exactly is all the fuss about?".
This is usually because you are leaving the context
of your questions far too broad.

For instance: "how can I get better at engineering?"
has many answers and paths you can take, this can
lead to rather vague and unhelpful answers. A better
question is "what topic should I focus on first
to improve my engineering skills?" even so, this
leads to a lot of interpretation of the AI.


## So How Should I Write Prompts?

It isn't difficult, not at all. In fact,
it is simply being able to define and ask
the right questions in the right manner.

You should start by setting a context,
this can be done through the use of parameters
for the AI to follow. You can do this simply
by describing to the AI what you want it to be:

"You are a tutor of software development"

Will allow the AI to grab the context in which
you are addressing it, you can make this as detailed
as you like, the more detail the more likely you receive
a desired result, up to a point.

One you have defined the context it is a good idea to
set some parameters of what you want to do.
I think it best to simply show you some examples
at this point, as you will see exactly what I mean.


## Example 1 - Learning A Skill

"You are a professor of Software Engineering.
I am your student, I want you to use
the pareto principle, in which 80% of the effects
result from 20% of the topic, to create a focused
learning plan based around data structures and algorithms"


Here we define the context, we tell the AI what we want,
and we also tell it exactly what method it should go by
using to solve the problem.



## Example 2 - Study Schedule

"Create a study schedule for all of the above in
an appropriate amount of weeks. I am available to
study for 3 hours each day on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
and Friday. Please include time for revision and testing."

Here we make use of the output from the first example
to further create a study plan. We tell the AI
our schedule and tell it exactly what we want from
the plan, you can even include further detail
on subjects you would like to focus more if needed.


## Example 3 - Learning Resources

"Given the above schedule and the topics
from the initial response, please can you
suggest to me various learning resources
(including, books, videos, podcasts, and interactive exercises)
for the above topics that cater to different
learning styles."


## Example 4 - Discussion

"Using the Feynman Technique
explain to me the concept of
quadratic equations."

By using the Feynman technique
you will receive very simplistic explanations
in easy to understand terms.


## Example 5 - Visualisation

"I aim struggling to understand
neural networks, please can you
guide me through a visualisation
exercise which will help me to
understand the flow."

## Example 6 - Question Me

"I want you to act as a Socrat.
Using the Socratic method analyse
the logic in my statement and
provide feedback and questions.
Your task is to ask open ended
questions regarding my statements,
once I provide a response give me
constructive criticism to each
response before I ask the next question."


## Example7 - Oppose Me

"You are to act as an intellectual opposition.
I want you to analyse my thoughts and provide
constructive feedback. You should provide
counter arguments where possible and
point out flaws in my logic where you
find them"

## Example 8 - Guide Me

"You are to act as a tutor.
I want you to assist me in building
a social media application, however,
I do not want a direct answer to any
of my questions, instead, you should
guide me loosely to the answer and ask
appropriate questions so that I may come
to the correct conclusion myself."
