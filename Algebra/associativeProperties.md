# Associative Properties

When we add or multiply real numbers it
does not matter how these numbers are grouped, the result of the multiplication will always be the same.

Intuitively we already know this, but we now want to formally articulate this as the Associative Property of multiplication.

Associative Property of Addition:
`(a + b) + c = a + ( b + c)`

Associative Property of Multiplication:
`(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`

In these forulae the Associative Property tells us that it matters not if we first add b to a  then then c to the result, not if we add c to b and then add a to the result the evaluation will remain the same.

Similarly, the Associative Property of multiplication tells us that it matters not if we first multiply a by b and then the result by c or vice versa, we will achieve the same evaluation just the same.

The associative property tells us that so long as the order of numbers remain the same, the parentheses may move without affecting the result.

e.g. `(2 * 3) * 5 = 2 * (3 * 5)`

Would be a true statement.
