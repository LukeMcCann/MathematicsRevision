# Commutative Properties

Similar to the associative property the commutative property also applied to addition and multiplication. The commutative property tells us explicitly that we may add or multiply numbers in any order: `2 + 5 = 5 + 2`

The important thing to remember about the commutative property is that it does not work for subtraction and division:
e.g. `6 -4 = 2 but 4 -6 = -2`
     `6 / 3 = 2 but 3 / 6 = 0.5`
