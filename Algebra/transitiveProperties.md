# Transitive Properties

The Transitive property is a logic property of Algebra which we all intuitively understand.

It is the property of which if we understand that `a` is equivalent to `b` and `b` is equivalent to `c` then `a` is also equivalent to `c`, we can write this more clearly as such:

if `a = b`
and `b = c`
then `a = c`

If we translate this into real numbers we can say that:

if we understand `5 = 4 + 1`
and we also understand that `4 + 1` is equivalent to `2 + 3` then `5 = 2 + 3`.

The term transitive comes from 'to jump'
as we essentially move from one place to another, we jump over the middle and link the ends together:

5 = 4 + 1
    4 + 1 = 2 +3
