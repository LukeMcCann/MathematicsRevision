# The Understood 1

So, we understand that 3x means that we multiply x three times. We also understand that in the case that a number is associated with a variable such as x we call it the coefficient of that variable. In this case we would say that the variable x has a coefficient of 3, but, what about the variables we have seen with no coefficient? well... while it may look to have no coefficient it actually does have a coefficient of 1.

In algebra when anything has a coefficient of 1 the coefficient is implicit. This means when we see a variable such as x we know that what is really intended by the lone x is 1x.

This means an expression like:
    3x + x

is actually:
    3x + 1x

which in and of itself simplifies to 4x.

If we want to think about this deeper we can say that everything really has a coefficient of 1. Since multiplying anything by 1 does not change it's value even a number such as 8 can be read as 1(8).

This idea of the understood 1 also applied to denominators of fractions. Every value has an implied denominator of 1.

The same as multiplication, division by 1 does not change the actual value, thus, x is also understood to be x/1 in the same manner that 8 would be 8/1.

Finally, we can extend the idea to our exponents too. x is understood to be x^1 and 8 would be 8^1.

We could even extend this rule to coefficients, denominators, and exponents. This would allow us to rewrite them as:

x = 1x^1
    -----
	  1

7 = 1(7)^1
    -------
	  1

So, this might seem like crazy theoretical nonesense, where would this actually apply?

We've already seen that this concept can allow us to simplify an expression such as 3x + x or 3x - x but lets look at some more examples.


Lets say we have the following problem:

Rewrite the expression as one fraction

2
- + x
3

Since we know that x has a denominator of 1 we can think of this as

2   x
- + -
3   1

In order to add fractions we first need
a common denominator. This means that the denominators must be the same. This is an issue at the moment as one denominator is 3 and the other is 1.

If we multiply the second fraction by 3/3 then we can make the denominators the same.

2   x * 3
- + -----
3   1 * 3

this becomes

2    3x
- + ---
3    3

This makes our denominators equivalent
allowing us to add our fractions.

2 + 3x
-------
  3
