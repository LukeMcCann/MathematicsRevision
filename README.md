# Mathematics Practice

This repository is mostly for my own personal learning.
After a few years outside of Academia working as a
full-time FullStack Developer I have begun to see
my knowledge of theoretical concepts dwindle.

As such, I am using this as an opportunity to revisit
old topics that I have not seen in a while, whilst also
hoping to simplify some of the concepts into a manner
more recognisable to those coming from a computing
background.
