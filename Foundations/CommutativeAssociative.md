# Associative and Commutative laws

The algebraic laws of association and commutation are intrinsically known by all adults. 
They are fundamental knowledge which comes naturally via basic mathematical reasoning. 
These laws are so simple you way even wonder why we name them, they are the foundation
of simplicity from which complexity arises, whether that be algorithmic mathematics,
quantum theory, or general relativity, these laws serve as the fundamental reasoning
behind all mathematics and represent basic facts which we can use to understand far
more complex mathematical models.

## Commutative

Commutative laws are laws which apply to addition and multiplication 
operations. The commutative laws state that the order in which
we multiply or addd two real numbers does not affect the result. 
This is named as such as the numbers can "commute" (switch places) 
and the calculation remains the same. 

1 + 2 = 2 + 1 = 3
a + b = b + a 

3 . 2 = 2 . 3 = 6
ab = ba

## Associative

Associative laws also apply to numeric operations of addition and 
multiplication. The associative laws state that the terms or factors may
be associated in any way desired. This holds true for ordinary arithmetic 
operations with real or imaginary numbers but there are exceptions to the rule
(such as nonassociative algebra). 

The associative property is a property of some binary operations, this means
that rearranging the parentheses in an expression will not change the result. 
In propositional logic associativity is a vlaid rule of replacement for expressions
in logical proofs.  In Lie algebras, the multiplication satisfies Jacobi identity 
instead of the associative law, which allows abstracting the algebraic nature of infinitesimal 
transformations.

It is important to note that associative rules apply to three or more items.

(1 + 2) + 3 = 1 + (2 + 3) = 6
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)

In this example note the parentheses. It does not matter which two numbers
we wrap in parentheses so long as the addition remains ordered, whether we 
wrap 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 either order will have the same result.

This also applied to multiplication:

(1 . 2 ) . 3 = 1 . (2 . 3) = 6
(a . b) . c = a . (b . c)


## Identity Property

Identity properties are pretty self explanatory. 
Identity properties are properties which do not
change the outcome of the expression:

2 + 0 = 2
a + 0 = a

2 . 1 = 2
a . 1 = a


## Zero Property
Similar to the identity property, the zero properties are
properties which always result in 0.

2 . 0 = 0
a . 0 = 0

0 / 1 = 0
0 / a = 0
