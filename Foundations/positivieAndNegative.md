# Positive and Negative

Think of a number line, if we have a positive number we move to the right from zero, a negative we move to the left. The sign tells us exactly which way to move. Now think about when we perform addition and subtraction. Essentially if we have 5-4 we actually have +5 and -4, the '+' sign tells us to move five to the right of zero in the positive direction, and the "-" sign tells us to do the opposite, thus we land on the answer +1.

By the very nature of this if we perform addition on two positive numbers the result will always be a positive. If we think of this directionally, this is because +5 and +5 will always be telling us to move in the positive direction to land on +10.

Subsequently a negative + a negative will always be a negative. If we once again imagine a number line, let us contemplate the expression: -4 -2 we see that -4 tells us to move 4 spaces in the leftmost direction to the negative side. This will have us land on -4. The second negative will then have us move another 2 spaces in the leftmost direction due to the "-" sign.

Effectively, in this case we can "cheat" and simply add the two numbers as positives and then replace the negative sign. From this we can deduce that any negative "n" plus any other negative "n2" equates to it's opposites multiplied by -1:

-n + -n2 = (n + n2) * -1

If you are paying attention you will also have noticed that adding a negative is actually the same as subtraction, thus we cana actually simplify the expression: -n + -n2
to -n -n2.
