# Positive and Negative

Think of a number line, if we have a positive number we move to the right from zero, a negative we move to the left. The sign tells us exactly which way to move. Now think about when we perform addition and subtraction. Essentially if we have 5-4 we actually have +5 and -4, the '+' sign tells us to move five to the right of zero in the positive direction, and the "-" sign tells us to do the opposite, thus we land on the answer +1.

By the very nature of this if we perform addition on two positive numbers the result will always be a positive. If we think of this directionally, this is because +5 and +5 will always be telling us to move in the positive direction to land on +10.

Subsequently a negative + a negative will always be a negative. If we once again imagine a number line, let us contemplate the expression: -4 -2 we see that -4 tells us to move 4 spaces in the leftmost direction to the negative side. This will have us land on -4. The second negative will then have us move another 2 spaces in the leftmost direction due to the "-" sign.

Effectively, in this case we can "cheat" and simply add the two numbers as positives and then replace the negative sign. From this we can deduce that any negative "n" plus any other negative "n2" equates to it's opposites multiplied by -1:

-n + -n2 = (n + n2) * -1

If you are paying attention you will also have noticed that adding a negative is actually the same as subtracting a positive, thus we can actually simplify the expression: -n + (-n2)
to -n - n2.

We have covered adding two positives and two negatives, and touched on subtracting a positive from a negative. Our next case is performing addition on either a Positive and a Negative, or vice versa. We can start by treating both numbers as positives, if we are trying to add -7 and 4 for instance we can first consider the expression as 7 and 4. Once we have both numbers represented as positive values we can say that the result will be positive if the positive number is larger, but negative if the negative number is larger. Here we can see that 7 is larger than 4, thus the negative number is larger than the positive, and we can see that the result will be a negative, specifically -3. If we look at another example: 10 + (-1)

If we imagine both numbers as positives we have 10 and 1. 10 is greater than 1 and is the original positive number, thus we can deduce that the result will be positive, and it is indeed 9. One more, we have: -12 + 8 we convert this to 12 and 8, we see that 12 is greater than 8, the original 12 is our negative number, thus the outcome will be negative: -4.

An exception to this rule is if the positive and negative number are opposites. Since both numbers will effectively cancel one another out the result will be 0. Think of this in terms of our number line. If I have 3 + (-3) I start by moving 3 places to the right, then immediately I must move 3 steps back to the left. This means I have just removed the exact quantity that I added, thus the result is 0.

Our next case is subtraction. If we subtract two positive numbers the result will be positive if the first number is larger, but negative if the second is larger: 3 - 4 = 3 + (-4) = -1

If both positive numbers are equal, the result is once again 0.
Some more examples:
  10 - 2 = 10 + (-2) = 8
	3 - 10 = 3 + (-10) = -7

If we perform subtraction on two negatives we flip the previous rule, if the second number is larger the result will be negative, if the first number is larger the result will be positive.

-3 - (-4) = -3 + 4 = 1

In this context "larger" refers to the number furthest to the right on our number line.

-10 - (-2) = -10 + 2 = -8


Finally, when we subtract a negative number from a positive the result will always be positive, this is due to the fact that the negative signs cancel out: 3 - (-4) = 3 + 4 = 7

And opposing this when we subtract a positive from a negative the result will always be negative: -3 - 4 = -3 + (-4) = -7


If it helps you can think of everything as addition and insert brackets in your mind: 4 + (-4) = 4 - 4

You can also think of addition as the + sign is telling you to move in the direction indicated by the preceding number, so if we have: 1 + (+3) the addition operator is saying to follow the direction of 3 which is a positive and thus we move to the right, if we have 1 + (-3) we would move to the left. Conversely the - sign tels us to move in the opposite direction to that which is indicated: -2 - (-3) = -2 + 3

# Multiplication

Previously we covered addition and subtraction, but what of multiplication? in this case we have three possibilities, we can multiply to positive numbers, two negative numbers, or one positive and one negative number.

When we multiply two positive numbers the result will always be positive, remember that multiplying is really just consecutive addition.
3 * 4 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12

This means the multiplication of two positive numbers will always be moving to the rightmost direction of our number line.

When we multiply two negative numbers the result will once again always be positive:
(-3) * (-4) =

I have not shown the consecutive addition for the above to avoid confusion. As we are dealing with two negatives the addition can be thought of as more of a subtraction as we are adding a negative.

When we multiply a positive number by a negative the result will always be a negative: 3 * (-4) = -3 + (-3) + (-3) + (-3) -12


To Summise:
	Positive * Positive = Positive
	Negative * Negative = Positive
	Positive * Negative = Negative
	Negative * Positive = Negative

An easy way to remember this is if the signs are the same the product with be positive, else it will be negative. Of course, 0 is not itself a signed number and multiplying by 0 is always 0. The order of numbers does not matter in multiplication.

Note that this logic does not hold up with more than two numbers, for instance, if we have (-2)(-3)(-4) then every two - signs we have will cancel out and become a positive. We can draw the conclusion from this that if we have an even number of - signs the result will be positive, if we have an odd number of negative signs the result will be negative.

Even  - : +
Odd   - : -

Looking at our example:

(-2)(-3)(-4) becomes (+2)(+3)(-4) this results in an odd number of negative signs which means we can expect the product to be negative: -24

# Division

Much like multiplication when we divide signed numbers we have three possibilities:

   1. We divide two positive numbers
   2. We divide two negative numbers
   3. We divide one positive and one negative number

Much like multiplication, when we divide two positive numbers the result will always be positive:
    6 / 2 = 3
		10 / 4 = 2.5

Similarly when we divide two negative numbers the result will always be positive:
   (-2) / (-3) = 4

When we divide a positive by a negative or a negative by a positive the result will always be a negative.

You will notice these rules follow the same pattern as multiplication.

To Summise:
	Positive / Positive = Positive
	Negative / Negative = Positive
	Positive / Negative = Negative
	Negative / Positive = Negative

Once again we derive that if the signs are the same the result will be positive, if the signs are different they will be negative. We cannot divide by 0, but if we divide 0 itself by any number the result will always be 0.

If we think of these results as fractions we can simplify by factoring out the negative sign to the front of the fractions, this will not change the value of the calculation as a/(-b) and -a/b are equivalent fractions. If we have both a negative numerator and denominator we can rewrite the fraction using 1 as the value for each side, since multiplying by 1 does not change the value of a number, thus (-6)/(-3) can also be written as (-1)/(-1)*(6/3) both of these expressions then simplify to 6/3 which should be evident by the fact we are multiplying by -1 which we know flips the sign to the opposite, however, since we have two negative signs we know these cancel out into two positives.
