# Identity Numbers

Identity numbers are numbers that don't change the identity
of the original value.

The identity for addition is 0
The identity for multiplication is 1

The reasoning behind this is that you can add 0 to any number
and it doesn't change the original value.

You may also multiply any number by 1 and, just the same as adding 0, it does not change the original value: [IdentityNumbers.md](../Matlab/identityNumbers.m).

We can think of identity numbers as those which do not change the identity of a given number.

For example: 17 + 0

We intuitively know if we have 17 of something and add nothing to it we will still have 17 of the thing.

We can solve this without thinking in terms of identity numbers, however, if we are to think of it in terms of identity numbers we should already know that 17 + 0 = 17 since we are adding 0 and we know that 0 is the identity number for addition. Because of this we know that adding 0 to 17 will not change the identity of 17 so 17 + 0 will still be 17.

While we don't need identity numbers to tell us these objective truths, the concept of identity numbers sets to confirm that anything multiplied by 1 or added to 0 will not change the identity of the number 4 * 1 will still be 4.
