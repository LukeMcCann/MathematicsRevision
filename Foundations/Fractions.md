# Fractions

Fractions are what we call Rational Numbers. As we already know the set of all Rational Numbers are numbers which are representable by fractions, we classify them this way as they are the 'ratio' of integers. What does this mean? in simple terms if we were to take two integers: 5 and 7 for instance, we can represent a division of these numbers by a fraction:

<pre>
              5
             ---
              7
</pre>

we can read this as "5 divided by 7" or even "5 over 7". Fractions may look completely different to the numbers we are used to but the way we think about fractions is simple as a part of a whole. A fraction always as two numbers; the numerator, and the denominator. As the denominator is the item we are dividing by it is not possible to have a denominator of 0, after all, I can't have 5 out of 0 of an item as there isn't 5 in 0. The denominator can be thought of as the "total" and whole number of which we want a "piece" of. If I think of this in terms of a pie that I want to share with my friends we can think of it as:

<pre>
            5 pieces for me
            ---------------
            7 pieces in total
</pre>

that is a lot of pie... the fractions we have seen above are how we would traditionally write fractions, however, it is customary to write them as such: 5/7 when writing fractions in a line of text.

Percentages can be thought of as another representation of a fraction, when you hear "percent" you can simply think "divided by 100". This means that in order to turn a percentage value into a fraction we we can simply express it as a numerator of a whole: 56% = 56/100 = 0.56
